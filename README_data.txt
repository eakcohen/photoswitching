EXAMPLE DATA
This is in the form 'trace.mat' and is an example of 100 traces generated by a 3 state switching model whereby the absorption state can only be reached by the ON state. 
- The data is for Study 1 of Table 2 of Appendix B in the main paper 
- lambda = [0.3162, 0.3162], mu = [0 0.0105], nu = [0 1 0], delta>0 (UNKNOWN), false positive rate also unknown. 
To run: 
for the first trace
	[lambda,mu(,~,~,~,~,~] = likelihood_preds_m(trace(:,:,1),30,0,[0 1],1,[0 1 0]);



example: 
[lambda,mu,~,~,~,~,BIC] = likelihood_preds_m_manymax(Alexadata(1).Y,200,2,[0 0 0 1],1,0);
- uses the multimodal optimisation function
- uses the first dataset of the AlexaFluor data
- will output predicted lambda, mu and the BIC from a 5 state (m=2) model with absorption accessible from only the ON state (1), false positive observations and unknown NU parameter.
